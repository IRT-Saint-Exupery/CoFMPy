# API documentation

This is the API documentation blabla

## End-user documentation

As an end user, we suggest to start with the main object in CoFMPy: the [Coordinator](./coordinator.md).

## Developer documentation

As a developer, you may need to implement your own blocks, e.g. a custom data stream
handler. In this case, you must follow the same interface as the objects already
provided in CoFMPy: inheritance, abstract methods and members, etc.
